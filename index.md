## How It Works

The script runs in the background while you browse Google. It looks for AI summary boxes and hides them, making your search results cleaner and easier to navigate. This way, you can quickly find the information you need without the interference of AI-generated content.

### Code Snippet

Here’s a brief look at how the script operates:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Google AI Overview Blocker
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      1.0.0
// @description  Hides AI summary boxes in Google Search results
// @author       Your Name
// @match        https://www.google.com/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';
    const aiBoxes = document.querySelectorAll('.AI-summary-box-selector');
    aiBoxes.forEach(box => box.style.display = 'none');
})();
```

This simple code identifies the AI summary boxes and hides them, providing a straightforward solution to the clutter issue.

## Usage

Once installed, the script runs automatically whenever you perform a search on Google. You do not need to activate it manually. Just enter your search query, and enjoy a cleaner interface.

### Example

1. Open Google.
2. Type in your search query.
